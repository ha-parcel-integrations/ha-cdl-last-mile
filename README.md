A custom Home Assistant integration that tracks your [CDL Last Mile Solutions](https://cdldelivers.com) packages (US). No account is needed — you enter the tracking code yourself, just like on the CDL Last Mile Solutions tracking page.

> **Pre-1.0.** Built from the carrier's public tracking responses; a few details are still unconfirmed. Two scan wordings (`CDL Transfer Scan`, `Order Under Investigation`) are mapped but have not been seen yet, and scan times carry no time zone, so they are read as US Eastern time. Each of these logs one warning the first time it matters — please [open an issue](https://github.com/ha-parcel-integrations/ha-cdl-last-mile/issues/new?template=unrecognised_status.yml) with the logged line when you see one. Warnings name the wording or the assumption, never your parcel's data.

## Features

- Track any number of CDL Last Mile Solutions parcels by tracking code (a `CDL…` label number or an order number such as `123456789-0`) — no account needed
- Per-parcel sensor with the canonical status (`registered` / `in_transit` / `out_for_delivery` / `delivered` / …), the carrier's own status text and a tracking deep-link
- Summary sensors: incoming parcels, next delivery, recently delivered parcels
- `cdl_last_mile.track_parcel` / `cdl_last_mile.untrack_parcel` services, so a dashboard button can add a parcel
- Events + device triggers for no-code automations (parcel registered, status changed, delivered)
- Opt-in per-parcel status history
- Manual refresh button and a diagnostic last-update sensor

## Requirements

- Home Assistant 2025.12 or newer
- A CDL Last Mile Solutions parcel and its tracking code, from the shipping
  confirmation or the sender — no account needed. Two shapes are accepted: a
  label number (`CDL` plus 11 digits) or an order number (9 digits, a hyphen
  and 1 digit). An order number typed without its hyphen gets it back
  automatically.

## Installation

### HACS (recommended)

1. In HACS, choose the three-dot menu → **Custom repositories**.
2. Add `https://github.com/ha-parcel-integrations/ha-cdl-last-mile` as an **Integration**.
3. Install **CDL Last Mile Solutions**.
4. Restart Home Assistant if HACS asks you to.

Or click the button below to open it directly in HACS:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=ha-parcel-integrations&repository=ha-cdl-last-mile&category=integration)

### Manual

Copy `custom_components/cdl_last_mile` into your `config/custom_components/` folder and restart Home Assistant.

## Configuration

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=cdl_last_mile)

Or set it up by hand: add the integration via **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → CDL Last Mile Solutions**. There is nothing to fill in: the hub is created immediately (CDL Last Mile Solutions tracking needs no account).

Then add parcels via the integration's **Configure** dialog, the [`cdl_last_mile.track_parcel`](#services) service, or a [dashboard button](examples/dashboards/add_parcel_card.yaml). The tracking code is on your shipping confirmation or comes from the sender.

## Options

Open **Configure** on the integration entry:

| Section | Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Parcels | Add / remove | — | Manage the tracked tracking codes. Changes apply immediately, no restart. |
| Delivered parcels | Filter by / amount | last 7 days | How long delivered parcels stay visible on the delivered sensor. |
| Parcel history | Include status history | off | Adds a `history` attribute per parcel with each status update. |

Polling isn't one of these settings: the integration polls on a dynamic,
status-driven schedule with nothing to configure.

## Dynamic polling

Polling isn't a setting here — the integration adjusts its own cadence to
what your tracked parcels are actually doing:

- **Quiet hours** — no polling between 00:00–06:00 local time, aside from one
  catch-up check at each end of that window (around midnight and around 6
  AM), so an overnight update is never missed.
- **Hot (every 15 minutes)** — while any tracked parcel is out for delivery
  today, starting an hour before its delivery window opens (or immediately if
  no window is known yet, which is always the case here).
- **Normal (every 45 minutes)** — for anything else still on its way.
- **Fully paused** — once every tracked parcel has been delivered, or nothing
  is tracked at all, polling stops until you add a parcel back (adding one
  always triggers an immediate check, regardless of the pause).
- A small, fixed per-hub offset is added on top, so not every CDL Last Mile Solutions
  hub out there polls at exactly the same second.

CDL Last Mile Solutions publishes no delivery window or estimate, so a parcel that is out for delivery is checked every 15 minutes until it is delivered.

## Removal

Standard HA removal applies: **Settings → Devices & Services → CDL Last Mile Solutions → ⋮ → Delete**. Nothing is stored on CDL Last Mile Solutions's side.

## Sensors

| Entity | Description |
|---|---|
| `sensor.cdl_last_mile_solutions_incoming_parcels` | Number of active tracked parcels, full list under the `parcels` attribute |
| `sensor.cdl_last_mile_solutions_parcel_<code>` | One per tracked parcel; state is the canonical status, attributes carry the full normalised parcel |
| `sensor.cdl_last_mile_solutions_next_delivery` | Earliest expected delivery moment across all active parcels |
| `sensor.cdl_last_mile_solutions_delivered_parcels` | Recently delivered parcels (see the retention option) |
| `sensor.cdl_last_mile_solutions_last_successful_update` | Diagnostic: when CDL Last Mile Solutions was last polled successfully |

A delivered parcel moves from its per-parcel sensor to the delivered sensor automatically.

## Parcel status reference

The `status` field is the carrier-agnostic enum shared by the whole integration family:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `registered` | The shipper created the label, or CDL is still waiting to receive the package from the shipper |
| `in_transit` | Scanned at origin, transferred between facilities or received at a local delivery center |
| `out_for_delivery` | With the driver today, including the scan at the door |
| `delivered` | Delivered |
| `problem` | CDL reports a problem, for example a wrong address or an order under investigation |
| `unknown` | Not yet on CDL's system, or a scan wording we have not mapped yet |

`at_pickup_point` and `returning` never occur: CDL's tracking shows neither.

A delivered parcel is always reported as `delivered`, even when the door scan is listed after the completion in CDL's history.

The carrier's own human-readable text is always available as `raw_status`.

## Events

The integration fires these on the event bus (also available as device triggers on the CDL Last Mile Solutions device):

| Event | When |
|---|---|
| `cdl_last_mile_parcel_registered` | A new parcel appears in the active list |
| `cdl_last_mile_parcel_status_changed` | A parcel's canonical status changes (`old_status` / `new_status` in the payload), except the final hop to delivered |
| `cdl_last_mile_parcel_delivered` | A parcel is delivered |
| `cdl_last_mile_parcel_delivery_time_changed` | The expected delivery window changes — CDL carries no delivery window, so this does not fire today |

Every payload is the full normalised parcel plus the hub's `device_id`. Events are suppressed on the first refresh after start-up.

## Services

| Service | Fields | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `cdl_last_mile.track_parcel` | `tracking_code` | Start tracking a parcel |
| `cdl_last_mile.untrack_parcel` | `tracking_code` | Stop tracking a parcel |

## Examples

Ready-to-paste automations and dashboard snippets live in [`examples/`](examples/), including tracking a new parcel straight from a dashboard.

### Community Lovelace cards

Third-party cards that work with this integration's sensors:

- [jonisnet/hki-parcels-card](https://github.com/jonisnet/hki-parcels-card)
- [klaptafel/ha-package-tracker-card](https://github.com/klaptafel/ha-package-tracker-card)

## Debugging

```yaml
logger:
  logs:
    custom_components.cdl_last_mile: debug
```

## Troubleshooting

- **A parcel shows `unknown`** — CDL Last Mile Solutions does not know the code yet, or the code is wrong. It picks up automatically once the parcel is in their system.
- **Delivery times look hours off** — CDL stamps scans without a time zone and the integration reads them as US Eastern time. If your parcel's times are shifted, please open an issue.
- **A status logs "Unrecognised CDL Last Mile Solutions status"** — please [open an issue](https://github.com/ha-parcel-integrations/ha-cdl-last-mile/issues/new?template=unrecognised_status.yml) with the logged line so the mapping can be extended.
